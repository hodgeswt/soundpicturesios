Any audio recorded within the app is stored locally on your device but is not accessible to you or the developer after closing the record screen. Audio files are sent to http://soundpictures.herokuapp.com over HTTP, which is unsecure. Any files sent may be intercepted. The audio file is stored on the server temporarily to convert the audio to an image.
